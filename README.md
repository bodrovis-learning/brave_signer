# BraveSigner

> Bravely generate key pairs, sign files, and check signatures.

This program, written in Go, contains a collection of tools to generate key pairs in PEM files, sign files, and verify signatures.

## Usage

Run it:

```bash
brave_signer COMMAND FLAGS
```

Available commands:

* `keys generate [--pub-out pub_key.pem] [--priv-out priv_key.pem]` — generate an RSA key pair and store it in PEM files. The private key will be encrypted using a passphrase that you'll need to enter. AES encryption with Argon2 key derivation function is utilized.
* `signatures signfile --file PATH_TO_FILE [--priv-key priv_key.pem]` — sign the specified file using an RSA private key and store the signature inside a .sig file named after the original file. You'll be asked for a passphrase to decrypt the private key.
* `signatures verifyfile --file PATH_TO_FILE [--pub-key pub_key.pem]` — verify the digital signature of a specified file using an RSA public key and the signature file. The signature file should have the same basename as the actual file and be stored in the same directory.
